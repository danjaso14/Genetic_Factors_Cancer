Abstract:

African American mortality from prostate cancer has been shown to be twice that of European
Americans. It is well established that there exist socioeconomic factors that contribute to the
lack of healthcare resources available to African Americans. However, little is known about a
genetic basis for racial disparities in cancer. Moreover, racial genomic factors are not readily
available due to the lack of diversity present in our sequenced genome construct. Alternatively,
we use single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from common platforms such as 23andme
and ancestry.com to assess risk of prostate cancer and identify genes and their interactions that
are associated with prostate cancer in men of African ancestry. Our machine learning approach
is applicable to other diseases and conditions.
Our machine learning pipeline utilizes a SNP database we constructed from dbSNP, a publicly
available resource. We incorporate information on millions of cataloged human SNPs to arrive
at a candidate set of hundreds, which are then passed on to classification methods (Principal
Components Regression, Elastic Net, XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) to
classify individuals according to their prostate cancer risk. Exploratory data analysis and
visualization is performed on SNPs that are implicated in prostate cancer, utilizing techniques
such as Principal Components analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation to improve interpretability of
results.

Our work facilitates the use of genetic information to make insights into health and addresses
the lack of diversity present in genomic investigations. It is our goal to create a prostate cancer
risk profile tailored to African Americans to contribute to a hereditary cancer panel to screen for
risk of prostate cancer in African American men.
